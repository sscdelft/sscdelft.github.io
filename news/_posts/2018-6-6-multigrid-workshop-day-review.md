title: "Workshop day in review"
---

On **May 30th**, we held our annual workshop day. This year it was on multigrid and multilevel methods.
During this day, eight people from TU Delft and other institutes in the Netherlands and Belgium gave short presentations on their research.
The workshop was followed by a barbecue at freezone B with live music.
We would like to thank our six speakers Mousa, Roe, Prashant, Pieter, Marc and Frits, as well as our keynote speakers Kees and Hadi for their interesting presentations.
The book of abstracts as well as the slides of the presentations can be found [here].
