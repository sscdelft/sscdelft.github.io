Last Wednesday the SIAM student chapter organized a one-day workshop on Mathematical Modelling in Medicine. During this day 8 enthusiastic PhD candidates and 2 keynote speakers shared their research in short presentations. During the morning session, the focus was on mathematics in imaging, especially imaging using MRI. The afternoon session was on modelling in medicine, specifically on modelling cell migration and growth for different types of cells. For the book of abstracts, the presentations and some photos of the day, please see the [website].
