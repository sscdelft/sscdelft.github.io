We had our annual chess tournament on **11 December 2019** at the Senaatzaal in EWI. The tournament was won by Drs. Peter Van Nieuwenhuizen who was also the winner of the previous edition of this tournament.
The first runner-up position went to a new SIAM SC member, Jeremy Budd. And the second runner-up position went to our beloved Dr. Martin Van Gizen. The standings can be seen in the attached photos. We hope to see more of the SIAM student chapter members in our next edition of the tournament.
