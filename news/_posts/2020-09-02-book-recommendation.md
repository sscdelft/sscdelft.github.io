Do you have any worries or concerns? Do you want to consult someone to get advice but you only want to do it anonymously? Then I guess you are looking for the Namiya General Store :P

Today, the book we want to recommend is a Japanese novel: **The Miracles of the Namiya General Store by Keigo Higashino**。

In 2012, three delinquents, Atsuya, Shota & Kohei, take shelter in the abandoned Namiya General Store after committing some wrongdoings. Staying until the morning, the boys' pillaging is mysteriously interrupted by an advice letter being posted, although nobody is outside. The letter is addressed to the General Store and traditionally was written by someone to consult about worries. Upon reading, the boys realise it was written in 1980, 32 years ago. When Kohei decides to reply, the mysteries and secrets of the old General Store come to light, as their letters transcend time and space to touch a variety of characters, revealing the pasts of Namiya, and follows the many miracles that intertwine the lives of the seemingly unrelated cast.
  
“The key to accepting responsibility for your life is to accept the fact that your choices, every one of them, are leading you inexorably to either success or failure, however you define those terms.” (Neal Boortz)


We hope you will enjoy the book and all stay healthy.
