On January 22, Nicole Potters (library TU Delft) presented a baNaNa talk about
'Many ways to find your reference'.  She explained which databases can be used
to find references: for Applied Mathematics this can be found at [sources-am].
Furthermore, she explained how journals and papers can be found using the
'Search in collection' box.  Old papers (in print) can be read or copied at the
library, newer papers are available online.  Finally, she explained how [books
could be purchased][purchase-books] or [borrowed from other
libraries][borrow-books].
