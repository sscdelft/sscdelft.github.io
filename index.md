The SIAM Student Chapter Delft has been founded in 2014 by PhD students of the
[Numerical Analysis section at TU Delft][NA-EWI-TUD].  Our Student Chapter is
the first [division of SIAM][SIAM Student Chapters] in The Netherlands, and it is
meant to bring together MSc and PhD students, postdocs and professors from all
mathematically-oriented departments.  The Chapter organizes seminars, lectures
(both on research and on software tools), company visits and social
events.

Currently involved departments are:

* Applied Mathematics (sections Statistics, Mathematical Physics, Numerical
  Analysis)
* Aerospace Engineering (section Aerodynamics)
* Electrical Engineering (sections Circuits and Systems, Intelligent Electrical
  Power Grids)
* Marine and Transport Technology (section Offshore & Dredging Engineering)
* Geoscience and Engineering (section Petroleum engineering)

Our faculty advisors are [Kees Vuik] and [Martin van Gijzen].
