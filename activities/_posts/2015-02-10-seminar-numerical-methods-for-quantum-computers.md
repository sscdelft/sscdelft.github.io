In the second semester of the academic year 2014/2015 we organise a seminar on
'Numerical Methods for Quantum Computers'.  Quantum computing is one of the big
topics of the future.  This seminar will help you in getting familiar with this
completely new and unexplored field.  A detailed description of this seminar
can be found [here][seminar website].  For PhD students, active attendance will
be valued by GS points.
