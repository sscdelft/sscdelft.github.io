The [Project baNaNa] is a self-organised seminar from the PhD students of the
numerical analysis department at TU Delft.  Our aim is to present practical
tools and applications from the every-day use of a mathematician to each other.
The seminar will be held on a monthly basis and in an informal manner.

See [this][Project baNaNa] website for more information.
