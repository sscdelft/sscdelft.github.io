title: "Research Day"
---

Our research day definitely lies on the scientific and academic site of the spectrum of chapter activities. 
Every year we organize a one day workshop on a topic in applied mathematics. With this event we try to 
connect with SIAM chapters of other universities. Also, we give PhD students the possibility to present 
their work for an international audience, and get to know other PhD students in the same field. The links 
below give you more information about the past research days.
